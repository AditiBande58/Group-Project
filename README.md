# Group-Project

# Instructions
Objective:
Build a basic library management system in Java that can:

- Add books (title, author, ISBN, year, availability)

- Search books (by title, author, ISBN)

- Borrow and return books (update availability)

- View all available books

- Save/load book data to/from a file

# What to do
1. Implement Required Features (Divide Tasks):

Book Add/Remove: 1–2 people

Search & Borrow/Return: 1–2 people

File I/O (Save/Load): 1–2 people

2. Choose Appropriate Data Structures:
Use Java built-ins (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap, etc.) based on what’s most efficient for each task.

3. Testing & Integration:
Once individual features are done, test and integrate everything as a full system.

4. Write a Report:

Screenshots/emails showing group collab

What data structures you chose and why

Big-O time complexity of key methods

Assumptions made (if any)
